# Overview

## RStudio and version controls

RStudio includes integrated support for two open source version control systems:

- Git
- Subversion

For this lesson we will focus on Git.

## Two requirements

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) 

2. Be familiar with using RStudio Projects, which are required for version control features to be enabled
    - RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.

# Step-by-step

## Follow along demo

**Step 1:** Open your `palaeo_R` project in rstudio

**Step 2:** Configure rstudio.

tools >> Global Options >> Git/SVN >> Create RSA key  

Copy key and go to github.com

go to settings (under user icon) >> security

Paste rsa key

**Step 3** Configure git 

```{r, eval  = FALSE}
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "Jane Doe", user.email = "jane@example.com")
```

##
**Step 4:** Use the `usethis` package to add git to your project

```{r eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_git()# initiates a local git repo
usethis::use_github()# creates repo on github
```

Now restart rstudio.

This should have made a local repo and a copy on github. Should be a new Git tab in rstudio with solid green arrows. Some troubleshooting may be required.

You only need to do this once per project.



## Cloning

Can also clone projects already on github with

`usethis::create_from_github` 

or with file >> new project 


<br>

1. In RStudio, go to File, and then New Project
2. Click on *Version Control: Checkout a project from a version control repository*
3. Click on *Git: Clone a project from a repository*
4. Fill in the info:
    - URL: use HTTPS address
    - Create as a subdirectory of: Browse to where you would like to create this folder
        
        
## Step 5: Stage

**Stage your changes to be committed.**

<br>

1. Go to the Git pane in RStudio.
2. Stage the one or more of your code files by checking the boxes next to then, and hit Commit.

<br><br>

*Don't worry about the other files that appear in this pane, we'll get to them in a bit.*

## Step 6: Commit

**View the diff, and commit your changes, with a commit message.**

<br>

1. In the pop-up window view the *diff* for the Rmd file. You can view it for the HTML file as well if you like.
2. Enter an **informative** commit message, like "Changed analysis year to X", and hit Commit.

## Step 6: Push

**Push your changes to your GitHub repository.**

**push**: When using git push always means pushing commits from your local respository (your computer) to a remote repository (Github).

<br>

1. Now push your changes to GitHub by hitting Push.
2. Enter login information as needed.

<br><br>

*Getting an error? Can't push? See [here](https://github.com/jennybc/stat540_2014/blob/master/seminars/seminar92_git.md) under GitHub password.*

## Make an edit

Now edit the file you pushed.

Use the Diff button on the Git pane to see what changed


# Other day one essentials

## More info on the Git pane

File tracking:

- The RStudio Git pane lists every file thatâ€™s been added, modified or deleted. 

- The icon describes the change:
    + ![git-mod](fig/rstudio-git-modified.png) **Modified:** You've changed the contents of the file.
    + ![git-unt](fig/rstudio-git-unknown.png) **Untracked:** You've added a new file that Git hasn't seen before.
    + ![git-unt](fig/rstudio-git-deleted.png) **Deleted:** You've deleted a file.

You can get more details about modifications with a ![git-unt](fig/rstudio-git-diff.png):

- Green: added text

- Red: removed text

## .gitignore?

- `.gitignore`: Git uses this file to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit.
